Building PDFlib on Unix systems
===============================

To start the make process on Unix, type

./configure
make

Optionally, to run sample PDFlib applications in several programming
environments (including the scripting languages which have been
detected by configure), type:

make test

In order to install the library and the support for all detected
scripting languages, type:

make install

If you want to install only selected parts (e.g., only the PDFlib
C library or the Perl support), type "make install" in the
respective library.


Available configure options
===========================

Several options can used with the configure script in order
to override some default configuration options, or to assist
configure in finding some software locations on your machine:

--with-debug                Enable debugging configuration (implies static)
--with-static               Enable building the static library
--with-java=path            Set location of Java Developers Kit
--with-tcl=path             Set location of Tcl executable
--with-tclpkg=path          Set location of Tcl package install directory
--with-tclincl=path         Set location of Tcl include directory
--with-py=path              Set location of Python root directory

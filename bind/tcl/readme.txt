Notes on the PDFlib Tcl binding:

- You may have to change the name of the tclsh binary in the
  example scripts if you want to run them directly. Alternatively,
  you may want to create a symbolic link pointing to the installed
  version of tclsh.

- What about Tcl namespace support?

Win32
=====
- You will have to change pdflib.so to pdflib.dll in pkgIndex.tcl
